# SAP Virtual Machine
SAP is an assembly language created by the teacher who assigned this project. Our task was to create a virtual runtime in for the machine (to be written in Java), and then create 
a virtual runtime for a [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) (to be written in SAP and run on our runtime). You can find the Turing Machine runtime code in `TuringVM/FinalTuring/TuringVM.txt`.
